COLUMNS: a, d ln a /dτsupercomoving/(H0/100), D+, d ln D+/ d ln a, D+(2), d ln D+(2) 
/d ln a with τsupercomoving is the integral of dt/a2, D+ the linear growth rate (not normalised to 1 at z = 0), D+(2) the second order growth factor, and d ln D+(2) /d ln a its logarithmic derivative with respect to ln a.

# RAMSES Cosmological Evolution tables [format: ASCII]

COLUMNS: a, H/H0,τsupercomoving· H0,tlookback·H0, tproper·H0 
with a = 1 at z = 0 (today), t and τ = 0 at z = 0, a is the expansion factor, H the Hubble constant defined as hexp=1/a da/dτsupercomovin,τsupercomoving the supercomoving conformal time (integral of dt/a2), tlookback is the look-back time, tproper is integral of dt/a and so the comoving distance is given by -(c/H0) · (tproper·H0).
